This repository is created to support two main parts of the thesis:

## 1. Data Analysis of Bioswale Response at AdeKUS Campus, Paramaribo

- A comprehensive analysis of the response of a full-scale test bioswale located at the AdeKUS campus in Paramaribo, Suriname.
- Includes code for converting TD-Diver data into water level measurements.
- Provides detailed data analysis and accompanying figures.

## 2. Simulations of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for Wakapasi Neighborhood

- Simulations exploring the potential impact of NbS under various climate and implementation scenarios for the Wakapasi neighborhood in Paramaribo.
- Detailed information about the model used for these simulations can be found [here](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/AST/Urban+Water+balance+model).


## 3. Maps

- The this maps contain cards with indicators for that are crucial for successful implementation throughout Greater Paramaribo. They can be used to identify potential locations.

For further details, please refer to the full thesis report once it is available on the TU Delft repository.
